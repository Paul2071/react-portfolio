# react-portfolio

My first attempt at a portfloio page, using a tutorial to get a finished product.
This was less about a learning experience than getting something up and running though I still learned a lot and managed to tweak it to make it unique to me.

Includes links to deployed apps I have made myself or as part of a team. 

Made using React, JavaScript and Tailwind.
